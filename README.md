### Note  
Selling a product may take a bit of time in case of slow or unstable internet connections, also the search bar is case sensitive.  
  
### What I Learnt  
- Implemented Firebase Auth with email/password and Google Sign in
- Integrated Firestore and Firebase Storage for data and images
- Got to know about various flutter packages and handling Futures and Streams
- Tried to make a good, user friendly, decent looking UI with animations
